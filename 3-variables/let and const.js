//before es6 version,there is only one way to create
//variable in javascript is using var keyword
var myvariable="some data"   

//in es6 version let and const are introduced
//variables

//var declaration with value
var myname = "md"
 
//var redeclaration with some variable identifier
var myname = "md fouzia"

//let declation with values 
let myhometown = "guntur"

//we cant redeclare let variables again
//let myhometown = "ongole" //javascript will throw errors 

// but we reassign new value to let or var 
myname="md fouzia sultana"
myhometown="hyderabad"


//for var and let we can reassign values(remove old value and update new value)

const dob = 29-6-1999
//for const we need to declare and assign the value 
// we cant reassign the const value
